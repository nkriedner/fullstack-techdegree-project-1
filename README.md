# Random Quote Generator

This project is the first project task for Teamtreehouse's "Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree".

The task was to build a page with a random quote generator using plain javascript.
The quotes on the page change randomly upon button click and/or automatically after 10 seconds.

The html and css files  were given by Teamtreehouse and not to be changed. The code I wrote for the pagination and filtering is in the script.js file in the js directory.
